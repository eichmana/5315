      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p>Docker uses containers to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications through the use of their tool.  The container allows the developer to know that applications can run on any other Linux machines regardless of custom settings.  Docker really mirrors a virtual machine except that docker allows apps to use the same Linux kernel as the system they are running on.  Also, Docker is an open source that anyone can contribute to meet their own needs.<p>    
      <p>Docker really helps developers in that they can focus on programming rather than system performance.  Further, since Docker is an open source developer can use other developers programming already set-up for Docker and save an immense amount of time.  Lastly, Docker can potentially reduce the amount of systems needed because of its small footprint and lower overhead.<p>

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
      <p>Nginx is Igor Sysoevs solution to existing web servers experienced in handling large numbers of concurrent connections.  Nginx uses event-driven, asynchronous architecture to become the fastest web server available.  Like Docker, it is also an open source software.  It is used for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and much more.<p> 

      <p>Several high-profile companies like T-Mobile, GitLab, Microsoft, IBM, and Google use Nginx on a daily basis.  It is built to offer high concurrency and very low memory usage instead of creating a new process for each web request.  One high level process and can control multiple worker processes.<p>

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p>A virtual machine is a file that has similar behavior to an actual computer.  It should be thought of as a computer within a computer that runs in window just like a normal computer.  The software inside of the virtual machine is not able to escape or involve itself with the computer in any way.  The virtual machine is a perfect environment for testing and beta releases.<p>  

      <p>Also, multiple machines can run at the same time on one physical computer.  An important piece of understanding a virtual machine is the hypervisor.  The hypervisor allows multiple operating systems to run side-by-side and manages those operating systems.  The coolest feature of a virtual machine is that each one provides its own virtual hardware that maps to the physical computers which saves costs.<p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p>Digitalocean is an infrastructure provider that provides cloud services to developers that run applications on multiple computers simultaneously.  They offer droplets using terminals that can be used in different sizes.  There are also some out-of-the-box options including one-click applications that are popular among developers because it saves them time.<p>  

      <p>Speed and efficiency are large attractions that Digitalocean offers as compared to AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud.  Developers also have said that it has a simple UI and minimalistic approach that makes it easy to pick up and use immediately.  Also, everything is documented including tutorials, how-to guides and walkthroughs.  Lastly, developers love the price at $5/month to get started.<p>
